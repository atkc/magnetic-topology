# magnetic_topology

Towards the grand vision of "button pressing" ease in topology analysis

#Orientation
The main files for data extraction are m1 and m2 -> run them sequentially

M1: For threshold operation -> right now we have to visually chek if the threshold is good, details of how to control the operation is in the file.

M2: For fitting routine -> Does iso and aniso 2D guassian fit, in dying need of fixing the window for fitting (see job list)

Analysis operations are by m3 and m4

M3.: Does orientational (#NN, Angles between NN) and translational analysis -> needs a lot of upgrades

M4.: Normalized analysis

#Directions(broadly)
1. Fixing pressing problems- ie. window for fitting
2. Upgrading the code- ie. UI for easy usage and automation of manual processes
3. Adding new functions- Stripe identification and analysis
